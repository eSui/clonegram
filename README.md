# Project Title

Workshop NYCDA: Students are required to build a blog using Ruby on Rails. Users should have basic functions with signing up, logging in, posting, editing posts, and deleting posts.  

## Getting Started

To get started, be sure to run rails db:migrate to initialize the Gemfile. From there it should be easy to sign up and start posting. A seed file is in the works so a single user can still interact with other users.  

### Prerequisites

```
rails db: migrate
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With

Notable Gems:

* [Simple-form]  
* [Bootstrap]
* [PaperClip]
* [Devise]



## Acknowledgments

* The staff at NYCDA, especially instructor Cam Crews and TA Oliver Huang
* The extremely well documented gems used.
* Ben Walker for giving countless hints in his tutorial on making the blog.
